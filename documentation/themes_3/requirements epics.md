"Basic tracking implementation"

Description: Basic tracking implementation involves setting up the Google Analytics tracking code on all pages of the website. This will allow the tracking of pageviews, sessions, bounce rates, and other basic metrics. It also includes enabling demographics and interest data, enabling site search tracking, and setting up custom dimensions and metrics.

Goals: The primary goal of basic tracking implementation is to accurately measure the website's traffic, user behavior, and demographic data. This will provide insights into how users interact with the website, which pages are popular, and how to improve the website's user experience.

User Stories: 
- As a website owner, I want to track the number of visitors to my website, so I can measure the website's traffic.
- As a marketer, I want to track user behavior, so I can optimize the website's content and layout to increase engagement.
- As a business owner, I want to track user demographics and interests, so I can tailor my marketing efforts to the target audience.

Dependencies: Dependencies for this epic may include ensuring that the website is set up correctly, that all pages have the same tracking code, and that the tracking code is installed correctly. Risks could include the possibility of errors in the tracking code, which could lead to incorrect data collection or inaccurate reports. To minimize these risks, it is important to thoroughly test the tracking code and to have a plan in place to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

Risks: 
The tracking code may not be installed correctly, resulting in inaccurate data.
Privacy concerns regarding the collection and use of user data.
Estimated Effort: The estimated effort for basic tracking implementation depends on the size and complexity of the website. It typically ranges from 8-16 hours.

Business Value: Basic tracking implementation is crucial for understanding website performance and user behavior, which can inform marketing and website optimization efforts. This can ultimately lead to increased website traffic, engagement, and conversions.

Priority: Basic tracking implementation should be considered a high priority as it is foundational for all subsequent Google Analytics implementation epics.
